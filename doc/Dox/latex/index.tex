The objective of this project is to design and implement a software package which reconstructs a 3-\/D object from its given orthographic views and from the given 3-\/D object gives its projections on a given cutting plane and its orthographic views(top, front, right side view). This document mainly talks about the mathematical model involved in this project and the algorithms to achieve the same. In this project we are considering only polyhedron 3-\/D objects which have flat polygon faces. For reconstruction of any polyhedron object, 3 orthographic views are sufficient and 2 orthographic views are necessary as some symmetric polyhedron objects can be uniquely reconstructed from 2 orthographic views.\hypertarget{index_assumption_sec}{}\section{A\+S\+S\+U\+M\+P\+T\+I\+O\+NS}\label{index_assumption_sec}

The projected views provided in the input are top view, front view and right side view of the object. Hidden lines are also treated as solid lines. \hypertarget{index_subsection2}{}\subsection{2\+D to 3\+D Transformation -\/}\label{index_subsection2}
Hidden lines also being shown as solid lines. The information provided about the object forms a valid 3D object. Provided projection forms a valid object.
